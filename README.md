# Project Brainstorming
---
## Disaster response: https://spacenet.ai/sn6-challenge/
### Notes:
* About mapping urban centers during storms/overhead
* Seems like it would be beyond our grasp

## Ship recognition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection
### Notes:
* Could be useful to protect against piracy, illegal fishing, trafficking etc.
* Seems like it might be more in our wheelhouse, yet still challenging

## Building Classification: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20100#learn_the_details-overview
### Notes:
* Useful for disaster relief among other things
* Seems like a more friendly version of the sn6-challenge.

## Search and Rescue: https://www.kaggle.com/jangsienicajzkowy/afo-aerial-dataset-of-floating-objects
### Notes:
* Useful in rescuing those lost at sea
* Might be in our wheelhouse

## Food loss detection: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16kKik2clGutKejU8uqZevNY6JALf4aVk2ELxLeR-msQ/edit
### Notes:
* Used to quantify how badly a community's resources have been harmed following a disaster
* Probably will be hard

## Tree type classification: https://www.ecodse.org/
### Notes:
* Used to understand and mitigate effects of global warming and introduction of invasive species
* No clue about difficulty

## Restoration of Sea Lions: https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-fisheries-steller-sea-lion-population-count
### Notes:
* Used to count number of sea lions in images which would allow researchers and scientists time to put their skills toward actually helping restore number of wild sea lions which is declining rapidly.
* Feel like it would be on the easier side compared to the other models listed above.

## Building classification: http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/challenge.html
### Notes:
* Dataset consists of footage post-hurricane harvey. Would be used for disaster relief. Seems as important as the first dataset/task, yet somehow easier. Seems promising

## Deteroriating (and subsequent restoration) of environment: http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/challenge.html
### Notes:
* Used for understanding when environments start to deteriorate and regenerate throughout seasons.

## Land Cover Classification: https://landcover.ai/
### Notes:
* Used for infrastructure design

## Iceberg Detection: https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge
### Notes:
* Could be used for a number of different things regarding climate change as well as preventing threats to navigation

## Settlement detection: https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/2021-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-track-dse/
### Notes:
* Used for detecting settlements which are deprived of electricity.

## Location of deforestation and human encroachment: https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space
### Notes:
* Used to help landholders make informed decisions about how/when they might need to respond.

## Time flow prediction: https://www.kaggle.com/c/draper-satellite-image-chronology
* Used to create chronological ordering of images to then determine if a process is deteriorating or regenerating

## Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Degredation: https://www.kaggle.com/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation
